This project is for generating Java parser of a given language, and computing semantic-directed attribute values.

"parserGen" is the directory for the project. "parser" contains the corresponding generated Java parser. The grammar is defined in "productions.txt", "symbols.txt", and "tokens.txt" under "parserGen", which defines the productions (and comment-style lines that follows a production are the semantic attributes and their calculation rules, in Java), token names that are used in productions, and what the tokens represent (in Java regular expression).

In this example, we define binary real numbers and calculate their values in a decimal sense. Explanations of the tokens are given here for your convenience of reading the example.

EXP	Expression
E	Expression (the first production in the file must be a one-to-one production, that's why we have EXP -> E)
BINARY	Binary integer
B	Binary figure (0 or 1)
ONE	Binary 1
ZERO	Binary 0
DOT	Binary point
